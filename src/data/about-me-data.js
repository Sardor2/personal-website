const aboutMe = {
  text: 'I have over year of experience as a web developer. I have worked on small projects and contributed to a big project like Biznes Rivoj as an intern. While I possess knowledge on Full-stack development, my current expertise is in building frontend applications. While I`m extremely attracted to working on real world projects, I consistently polish my tech skills along the way via quality online courses and brilliant books. This allows me to simultaneously gain more experience and grow as an engineer. Right now, Iâ€™m looking for a front-end engineer job or internship where I can be a part of great team and take my skills and experience to a new level. ',
